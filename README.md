# Axit
A PSD to HTML/SCSS/JQuery project with Bootstrap 3.  
Design is based on axure web design, the PSD file is available online and you can find it [here](https://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/axit-psd-landing-page/)  

Converting the final design into a Front-End web page with a slight animation using HTML, SCSS & JQuery and based on the Bootstrap framework. 

Instead of extracting icon assets from PSD we used Font-awesome, And for scroll animation used niceScroll.  

Using gulp Task Runner for auto-refresh and compiling SCSS into CSS.  

This was a front end web series project by ElZero [How To Design with Bootstrap 3 - Design 2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDoPjvoNmBAxYmbhnyM0yxH3OzhoDiAP9), in html,css,jquery. I extended the responsivity, menu scroll and a top scroll button at the bottom of the page.

## Future:
